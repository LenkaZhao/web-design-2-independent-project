      <p>In ancient China, women attached great importance to their hair and they paid great attention to matching their hair with their hair accessories. For example, they would wear different crowns when they went out to worship Buddha, on excursions or to visit the market. In ancient times, women of different class status wore different styles of crowns. Compared to women of ordinary class, noble princesses and women in the palace wore a lot of high-class jewelry, and most women of that class would use some precious gold and silver as crowns, a practice that could look noble and on the other hand make themselves look more dazzling and easy to attract the attention of their male partners. But whether it is a high status concubine wearing expensive crowns made of gold and silver, or an ordinary class of women wearing wooden crowns, in ancient China, girls like to wear good-looking crowns.</p>
